# Datreon 
## Overview
A social media application with privacy and payment at the heart of it. So just like Instagram,
people can share their photos and videos, but there is a twist, for every item shared, they can
charge money for it or for free like the normal way. Now, what if the content is vulgar or people
are not following the rules? Should the administrator ban them? No!!!. There should be a voting
system where people using applications decide whether to keep or remove people from the
platform. Not just that, as part of extended targets, we can use NFTs of people as their profile
pictures.
